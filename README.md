### Introduction
There are two files in this repository.

* MDSU_Corpus_with_preprocessing.txt

#### MDSU_Corpus.txt
MDSU_Corpus.txt includes the original tweet texts and their corresponding polarities.

#### MDSU_Corpus_with_preprocessing.txt
To save the time of preprocessing and to alleviate the divergence between different preprocessing methods when comparing with our method, we also offer a version with preprocessed fields.

Their descriptions are as follows.
* tweet:
the original tweet text of a tweet.
* tweet_preprocessed:
the preprocessed tweet text of a tweet.
* tweet_translation:
the English translation of a non-English tweet.
* tweet_translation_preprocessed:
